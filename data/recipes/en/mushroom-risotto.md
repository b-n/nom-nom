# Stock

Put a pot of 1.5l water on to boil, and add 2 stock cubes.

---

# Rice

Add 2 tbsp olive oil to a pot on high heat. Add 250g risotto rice, and fry the rice in the pan for 1-2minutes (don't let it burn).

If using wine, then quench the rice with a splash of white wine. Let this cook off.

Reduce the heat to a medium simmer, and start the rice cooking by adding 1 ladle of the vegetable stock.

Add the vegetable stock ladle by ladle, until the rice is 5 minutes under cooked (a little harder than al dente).

# Cooking

Between adding ladels of stock, prep the following ingredients:

Slice 250g champignons

Grate 60g mature cheese

Slice 2-3 spring onions into small circles

---

# Serving

In the last 5 minutes of cooking the rice, add the champignons, and spring onion. Continue cooking until your liking.

Add the grated mature cheese, and mix through to thicken up the risotto. Add salt and pepper to your liking.

Serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.
