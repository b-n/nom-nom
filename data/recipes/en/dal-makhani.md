# Soak

Soak 200 g black lentils and 50 g red kidney beans overnight.

--- 

# Prep

Chop 1 small onion.

Rinse the soaked dal, add to a pot of water covered with 2cm of water, and bring to a boil.

Add 1 bayleaf, 1 tbsp garlic paste, 1 tbsp ginger paste, 3 cardemon pods, 1/2 tsp salt, and the chopped onion.

Boil for at least 60 minutes on a low boil with the lid on.

By this time there should be no hard black lentils. If there are, continue cooking for another 10-15minutes.

Mash the dal with the back end of a ladle.

Add extra water if needed to ensure it is still liquid.

# Tempering

Mince 1 onion.

Cut 2 tomatoes into blocks.

Melt 40 gr butter in a pan, and add 2 tsp cumin seeds.

When the cumin seeds are popping, add 1 tsp ginger paste, 1 tsp garlic paste, the minced onion, and saute until cooked (~2 minutes).

Add the diced tomatoes, and saute for a further 3-4 minutes (breaking apart the tomato further), this should drive off most of the water.

Add 1 tsp kashmiri chili powder, 1 tbsp koriander powder, and 1/4 tsp garam masala.

Saute until aromatic. 

Add a small amount of water if necessary to ensure spices cook.
