# Ingredients

- Leftover Mushroom Risotto
- 100 gram mature cheese

# Prep

Heat enough oil for frying in a deep pot.

Grate 100 g mature cheese, and mix it with the left over risotto 4 parts to 1 in a large bowl.

Set up 3 dipping bowls in the following order: flour, beaten egg, breadcrumbs

# Balls

Form the risotto cheese mix into balls, 3-4cm in diameter.

Dip the balls in each bowl covering the entire surface from flour, to egg, to breadcrumbs.

Place the balls on a plate ready for frying.

# Frying and Serving

Fry the balls 5-6 at a time in the frying oil. They are ready when golden brown, and the cheese is melted on the inside.

Serve with truffle mayo, and grated parmesan cheese.

Tip: The oil is ready if a small amount of bread begins to fry immediately when touching the oil.
