# Cooking the Dal

Add 1 1/4 cup washed split yellow pigeon peas to a pressure cooker pot with 3 cups water.

Add 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 of the chopped tomatoes, 1/2 of the chopped ginger, 2 tbsp chopped onion to the pot.

Closed the pressure cooker, and put it on the heat. Cook for 10 minutes from when the pressure is reached. Let the pot naturally cool to release the pressure (5-10 minutes).

Note: Wait 4-5 minutes before starting to cook the first tempering. Now is a good time to prepare some of the mixtures of spices in bowls to make for easy addition. If eating with naan, make sure your oven is preheated, and follow the instructions.

# Cooking

To the tempering add 1/8 tsp asafoetida and 1/2 of the chopped green chilis. Saute for a minute.

Add the remaining 1/2 chopped tomatoes, and saute for 3-4 minutes until soft and cooked down.

Add 1/2 cup water and let it cook down a bit (make sure it doesn't dry out entirely).

# More cooking

To the tempering add 1 tsp red chili powder, 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tbsp kasuri methi, 1 tsp salt (to taste), 1 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (chopped).

Cook/saute for 2-3 minutes (until aromatic).

Add the cooked dal mixture, mix thoroughly, let it come to a boil, then remove from the heat.

Note: Keep the tempering warm whilst preparing the second tempering (although it should be fine off the heat since the second tempering doesn't take long.

# Tempering 2

To a small frying pan (tadka pan), add 2 tbsp oil/ghee and heat on a medium/high heat.

Add 1/8 tsp asafoetida, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tablespoon garlic paste, the remaining chopped ginger, 1 tbsp diced onion (set aside in step 3), and saute for 1-2 minutes (until aromatic).

Note: The second tempering takes 3-5 minutes, so think about naan if you're planning on eating with naan.

# Making it spicy

To the second tempering pan add the remaining chopped green chilis, 1 bay leaf, 4 cloves, 1 tsp red chili powder and saute for 1-2 minutes.

Note: If the tempering is thick, add more oil/ghee. It should be a mix of ingredients and red oil in the end.

# Serving

Split the first tempering into bowls. Drizzle the second tempering on in the middle. Eat with some naan and your hands (it makes it taste better).

Bhojan kaa aanand lijiye!
