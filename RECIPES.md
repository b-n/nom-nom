# Recipe Guidelines

This is the style guide for writing recipes

## Contentful

- Only publish recipes when both translations are available
- Make sure to public the steps before publishing the recipe
- Make sure the recipe has a hero image (preferably 16:9 ratio)

## Ingredients

- Order the ingredients as follows
  - Dried beans/main ingredients (e.g. dried chickpeas, toor dal)
  - Whole vegetables (e.g. tomatoes, onions, chilis)
  - Whole herbs/spices (ginger, garlic, cumin seeds, bay leaf)
  - Powder herbs/spices (e.g. coriander powder, tumeric)
  - Toppings/last additions (e.g. fresh coriander leaves, kasuri methi)
  - Common ingredients (e.g. water, oil, salt)
- Units of measure:
  - English:
    - Units: tsp, tbsp, cup, g
    - Style: [quantity] [unit] [ingredient]
  - Dutch:
    - Units: tl, el, kup, gram
    - Style: [quantity][unit] [ingredient]
- Try to keep one list of ingredients. Optional can be specified under a separate heading

## Instructions

- Try to keep steps isolated. i.e. don't refer back to previous steps
- Keep heading clear as to what the step is. Okay to repeat from other recipes
- Ingredients
  - If the ingredient was prepared in a previous step, use a descriptive name. e.g. 1/2 of the chopped apple
  - Always specify the unit of measure in the step. e.g.
  - Bold the ingredient with it's unit of measure
- Use command language. e.g.
  - Put x in the pot
  - Boil 200ml water with 2tsp salt
- Describe the state at which the step is complete if possible. If using times, do so to give an estimate for what
  is expected, and/or it's needed for a specific amount of time. e.g. Cook 2 minutes or until glazed.
