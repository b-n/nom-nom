# Chopping

Chop the potatoes into blocks.

Peal 500g sweet potatoes and chop into blocks.

Chop 500g carrots into blocks.

Separate the garlic gloves from the stem of 1 whole garlic.

Slice 1 onion into rings.

Tip: The harder the vegetable, the smaller it should be compared to the rest of the vegetables, as these take longer to cook.

# Roasting

Put the seasoned veges onto an oven dish and cook in the middle of the oven for 20-25 minutes.

Rotate the veges and cook for another 10-15 minutes.

Check the vegetables to see if they are cooked to your liking - carrots are better to check since they generally take the longest to cook. 

Tips:

- If the vegetables are cooked, but not to crispy, then turn on the grill, but keep a close eye because it will burn quickly
- Don't check the oven too often, it can cause things to take a lot longer to cook
- It will smell nice from about minute 20, but the longer you leave it to cook, the better the taste.
